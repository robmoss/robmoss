## Rob Moss

I'm a Senior Research Fellow in the [Infectious Disease Dynamics Unit](https://mspgh.unimelb.edu.au/research-groups/centre-for-epidemiology-and-biostatistics-research/infectious-disease-dynamics) at the University of Melbourne.

My research focuses on predicting and mitigating the burden of infectious disease epidemics, through the use of mathematical/computational modelling and Bayesian inference.
See [my website](https://robmoss.github.io/) for further details.

### üíª Reproducible research

- We are developing [Git is my lab book](https://git-is-my-lab-book.net/), a set of online training materials for enabling researchers to independently implement reproducible research practices in their own work.

- In parallel, we are growing a [Community of Practice](https://git-is-my-lab-book.net/community/) to support knowledge sharing, skill development, and refinement of our training materials.

### üßê Peer code review

- Peer code review should be an integral aspect of computational research.

- Code is the **ultimate form** of expressing **what you did** and **how you did it**.

### üêß Open source software

- I create [open source software packages](https://robmoss.github.io/#open-source-software-packages).

- I use [Debian Linux](https://www.debian.org/), [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [R](https://www.r-project.org/).
